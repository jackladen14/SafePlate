# SafePlate
Code for the software of the SafePlate Device - Senior Capstone Design - Completed 2023
The code provided is intended for use in the SafePlate system. This is a device meant to track changes in pressure on a floor by measuring the change in voltage across the mat. Full project description is available with access to the University of Kentucky Engineering Department. Read the final paper for instructions on recreating this project. 
There are 3 files here. The file titled "SafePlate.zip" is the code built on the IntelliJ IDEA and runs the user interface of the system. "Final Code for Arduino.ino" is the code for the Arduino Uno that was used in the project. "ESP32 Code.ino" is the code for the Sparkfun ESP32 Thing.
